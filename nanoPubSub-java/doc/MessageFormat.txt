Message Types
-------------

subscription message.
This message will subscribe the client with a 
given id for a given topic at the broker

#sub#<clientId>#<topic>#

un-subscription message
This message will unsubscribe the given client 
from the given topic at the broker 

#unsub#<clientId>#<topic>#


Standard message
This is a standard message which is sent by a client
to the broker and is published to all registered clients on the given topic.
The sending client will not receive the message again

#msg#<clientId>#<topic>#<message>#


TODO
----
- subscription and unsubscription should send acknowledge packets to the client
- there should be some kin dof ping message and reply that is send by the broker to check
if a client is still alive, if the client becomes inactive the broker should stop publishing to it
DISCUSSION: should the client be removed or should it get some kind of sleep state which is recovered on the next message
